# Python Tkinter Tutorial – FAQs

## What is Tkinter in Python Used For?

Tkinter is the standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) toolkit in Python. It is used to create desktop applications that are easy to use and visually appealing. Tkinter provides various controls, such as buttons, labels, text boxes, checkboxes, and more, which are used to build interactive applications. It is widely appreciated for its simplicity and serves as a straightforward way to create GUI applications quickly.

## How to Run Tkinter Program in Python?

To run a Tkinter program, you need to import the Tkinter module (usually imported as `tkinter` in Python 3), create a GUI application main window, and then add widgets and event bindings as needed. Below is a basic example to get started:

```python
import tkinter as tk

def main():
    # Create the main window
    root = tk.Tk()
    
    # Create a label widget
    label = tk.Label(root, text='Hello, Tkinter!')
    label.pack()
    
    # Start the GUI event loop
    root.mainloop()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Import Tkinter**: The `tkinter` module is imported to access its classes and functions.
2. **Create Main Window**: `tk.Tk()` initializes the main window.
3. **Add Widgets**: A label widget displaying "Hello, Tkinter!" is added using `tk.Label()`.
4. **Event Loop**: `root.mainloop()` starts the GUI event loop, allowing the application to respond to user actions.

This script creates a window containing a single label saying "Hello, Tkinter!". You can customize and expand it to build more complex GUI applications.
