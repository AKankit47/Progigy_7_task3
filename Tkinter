#What is Tkinter in Python Used For?

Tkinter is the standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) toolkit in Python. It is used to create desktop applications that are easy to use and visually appealing. Tkinter provides various controls, such as buttons, labels, text boxes, checkboxes, and more, which are used to build interactive applications. It is widely appreciated for its simplicity and serves as a straightforward way to create GUI applications quickly.


How to Run Tkinter Program in Python?

To run a Tkinter program, you need to import the Tkinter module (usually imported as tkinter in Python 3), create a GUI application main window, and then add widgets and event bindings as needed. Here is a basic example to get started:


import tkinter as tk

def main():
    # Create the main window
    root = tk.Tk()
    
    # Create a label widget
    label = tk.Label(root, text='Hello, Tkinter!')
    label.pack()
    
    # Start the GUI event loop
    root.mainloop()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

In this script, a window containing a single label saying “Hello, Tkinter!” is created, and mainloop() keeps the window open.
